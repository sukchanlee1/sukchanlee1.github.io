I'm a master's student in the [Department of Linguistics](https://linguist.snu.ac.kr/) at Seoul National University.
I try to do both syntax and semantics, mainly in Korean but often in comparison with other languages.
I'm especially interested in conditionals, modality, imperatives, negation, coordination, and focus particles like *only* and *even*.
Right now, I'm writing my thesis on negative imperatives in Korean.

When I’m not doing linguistics, I’m probably listening to music, watching movies, swimming, or playing with my dog Maru.
